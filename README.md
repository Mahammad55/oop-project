# Java Calculator Application
This is a simple calculator application implemented in Java as part of an Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) project. The calculator supports basic arithmetic operations as well as additional functions specific to different calculator models.

## Features
*Addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division operations.

*Additional functions based on the calculator model:

   *Apple Calculator: Power and square root.
   
   *Huawei Calculator: Sine and cosine.
   
   *Samsung Calculator: Logarithm, natural logarithm, and base-10 logarithm.
   
   *Xiaomi Calculator: Round, round floor, and round ceil.
## Usage
To use the calculator, follow these steps:

1.Run the Program class.

2.Choose one of the four available calculators (Apple, Huawei, Samsung, Xiaomi).

3.Select the desired operation from the provided list.

4.Input the required numbers for the chosen operation.

5.View the result and proceed to the next operation or switch calculators.
